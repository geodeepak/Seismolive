### MacPorts

A very convenient method to install and update ObsPy on various versions of Mac OS X and Python, along with a large choice other Python packages is through the MacPorts Projects package management system (http://www.macports.org). This is especially true for users already using MacPorts. Not-yet-users of MacPorts are encouraged to give it a try! The method via MacPorts would install all dependencies and ObsPy either from a pre-compiled binary package or from source. Here the details:

### Homebrew

Another package manager for OS X is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). It provides recipes for many different codes and usually compiles them during the installation. This is probably the most work from all alternatives presented here but arguably also the most flexible one.
