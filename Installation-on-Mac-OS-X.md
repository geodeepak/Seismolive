### App

**The App will not receive any future updates and it does not contain the latest ObsPy version. We will leave it up for a while because some people might still want it. Please use one of the methods mentioned below to install ObsPy! It is just too much work to keep the App up to date. Thanks for your understanding.**

### MacPorts

A very convenient method to install and update ObsPy on various versions of Mac OS X and Python, along with a large choice other Python packages is though the MacPorts Projects package management system (http://www.macports.org). This is especially true for users already using MacPorts. Not-yet-users of MacPorts are encouraged to give it a try! The method via MacPorts would install all dependencies and ObsPy either from a pre-compiled binary package or from source. Here the details:

### Homebrew

Another package manager for OS X is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). It provides recipes for many different codes and usually compiles them during the installation. This is probably the most work from all alternatives presented here but arguably also the most flexible one.
