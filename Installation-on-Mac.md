## Automatically

The easiest way to install ObsPy under Mac is to use the fully self contained OSX Application of ObsPy and all its dependencies. No need to install anything else, just this one application.

  * [[OSX Application|Installation on Mac with OSX Application]]

## Manually

If you cannot use the self contained installer, you can build ObsPy and the dependencies from source:
