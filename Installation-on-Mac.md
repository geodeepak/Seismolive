### App

The easiest way to install ObsPy under Mac is to use the fully self contained OSX Application of ObsPy and all its dependencies. No need to install anything else, just this one application. This is great for acquiring a fully working ObsPy environment very quickly. It might prove problematic to install additional modules if your OS X version and the one where the app has been compiled on differ too much. In that case please consider one of the options presented below.

### MacPorts

A very convenient method to install ObsPy on various Mac OS X versions and along with various other python packages is though the MacPorts Projects package management system (http://www.macports.org). This is especially true for users already using MacPorts. Not-yet-users of MacPorts are encouraged to give it a try! The method via MacPorts would install all dependencies and ObsPy either from a pre-compiled binary package or from source. Here the details:

### Homebrew

Another package manager for OS X is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). It provides recipes for many different codes and usually compiles them during the installation. This is probably the most work from all alternatives presented here but arguably also the most flexible one.
