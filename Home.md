ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a **Python framework for processing seismological** data. It provides parsers for common file formats, clients to access data centers and seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of seismological time series.

The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate **rapid application development for seismology**.

## Getting Started

The [ObsPy Gallery](http://gallery.obspy.org) and its related [ObsPy Tutorial](http://tutorial.obspy.org) are maybe the best point to get a first impression of what ObsPy is all about. The tutorial is a collection of short example programs with explanations and program output. For help getting started with Python, have a look at this [collection of links to Tutorials](wiki/Python-Tutorials).

## Installation

ObsPy is currently [running and tested](http://tests.obspy.org) on Linux (32 and 64 bit), Windows (32 bit and/or 64 bit) and Mac OS X.

ObsPy runs on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. We highly recommend and only officially support the latest release of each series.

**For individual users we strongly recommend [[Installation via Anaconda|Installation via Anaconda]].**

## Stay Informed

If you are using ObsPy we **strongly recommend** you join the [ [obspy-announcements] ](http://lists.obspy.org/listinfo/obspy-announcements) and the [ [obspy-users] ](http://lists.obspy.org/listinfo/obspy-users) mailing lists. The **[obspy-announcements]** list will be the place where new additions, important changes and bug fixes will be announced and thus will be very low volume. The **[obspy-users]** list is used to contact other ObsPy users for questions and open discussions.
