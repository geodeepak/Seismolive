ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a **Python framework for processing seismological** data. It provides parsers for common file formats, clients to access data centers and seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of seismological time series.

The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate **rapid application development for seismology**.

## Getting Started

The [ObsPy Gallery](http://gallery.obspy.org) and its related [ObsPy Tutorial](http://tutorial.obspy.org) are maybe the best point to get a first impression of what ObsPy is all about. The tutorial is a collection of short example programs with explanations and program output. For help getting started with Python, have a look at this [collection of links to Tutorials](wiki/Python-Tutorials).

## Installation

ObsPy is currently [running and tested](http://tests.obspy.org) on Linux (32 and 64 bit), Windows XP/Vista/7/8 (32 bit and/or 64 bit) and Mac OS X.

* via [[Anaconda|Installation via Anaconda]], a scientific Python distribution (all systems) **(works without root access)**
  * Installation information for [MESS 2015](https://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/MESS): see [[here|Installation via Anaconda for MESS]]
* [[Debian/Ubuntu|Installation on Linux via Apt Repository]] via the package manager
* [[Fedora/CentOS|Installation on Linux via RPM Repository]] via the package manager
* Mac OS X via [[Homebrew|Installation on OS X using Homebrew]] or [[MacPorts|Installation on Mac OS X using Macports]]
* Windows from a [[pre-build package (PyPI)|Installation on Windows using a pre-build package (PyPI)]] or from [[source|Installation on Windows From Source]]
* [[FreeBSD|Installation on FreeBSD]] via the package manager
* via [[PyPi or from source|Installation via PyPi/from source]], applicable to Linux and OSX

## Stay Informed

If you are using ObsPy we **strongly recommend** you join the [ [obspy-announcements] ](http://lists.obspy.org/listinfo/obspy-announcements) and the [ [obspy-users] ](http://lists.obspy.org/listinfo/obspy-users) mailing lists. The **[obspy-announcements]** list will be the place where new additions, important changes and bug fixes will be announced and thus will be very low volume. The **[obspy-users]** list is used to contact other ObsPy users for questions and open discussions.
