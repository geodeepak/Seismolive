## Welcome to ObsPy

A Python Toolbox for seismology/seismological observatories.

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a **Python framework for processing seismological** data. It provides parsers for common file formats and seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of seismological time series (see [Beyreuther et al. 2010](http://www.seismosoc.org/publications/SRL/SRL_81/srl_81-3_es/), [Megies et al. 2011](http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/4838)).

The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate **rapid application development for seismology**.

## Getting Started

The [ObsPy Gallery](http://gallery.obspy.org) and its related [ObsPy Tutorial](http://tutorial.obspy.org) are maybe the best point to get a first impression of what ObsPy is all about. The tutorial is a collection of short example programs with explanations and program output. 

## Installing ObsPy

ObsPy is currently [running and tested](http://tests.obspy.org) on Linux (32 and 64 bit), Windows XP/Vista/7 (32 bit and/or 64 bit) and Mac OS X (32 and 64 bit Intel and untested support for 32 and 64 bit PPC).

These notes describe installing ObsPy on the following platforms:
