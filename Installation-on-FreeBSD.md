## Automatically

Quote from Wen Heping (ObsPy package maintainer for FreeBSD):
```
Maybe below is a simple doc to tell the user how to
install obspy on FreeBSD:

1 # cd /usr/ports/science

2 select the obspy application you prefer and go into that
category, currently it include:

py-obspy-core
py-obspy.gse2
py-obspy.imaging
py-obspy.mseed
py-obspy.signal
py-obspy.wav
py-obspy.xseed

For example:
# cd py-obspy-core
# pwd
/usr/ports/science/py-obspy-core

3 # make install clean

That's all!
```

## Manually
